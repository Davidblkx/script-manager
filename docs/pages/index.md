## What is Script Manager?

Script Manager is a framework and cli tool that allows you to create and sync scripts across multiple machines. It uses a git repository as a source of truth for the scripts and a cli tool to manage them. It also provides common services that can be used by the scripts, like logging, configuration, file management, etc. The main idea is to easly install and start running scripts on a new machine, without having to manually copy them or install dependencies. It's built using [Deno](https://deno.land/).
